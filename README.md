[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kirylvolkau/docker-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kirylvolkau/docker-react)
# Sample react app deployed to AWS with help of Travis CI
**Attention!**: build is failing intentionally, I was testing Travis CI workflow. One of the tests always returns false. <br/>
**This repository is part of the `docker-course` repository** : https://github.com/kirylvolkau/docker-course <br/>
This repository contains:
* default React app 
* Single container
* Nginx
* `Dockerfiles` for different scenarios (developmet and production)
* `.sh` files used for experimenting on local computer with docker CLI commands and comments to them are stored in [sh folder.](/sh)
The app is deployed (not permanently!) to the AWS with help of Travis CI. If the link is not working it means that I disabled application.
